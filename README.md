# Vacuum Project

This project uses the Q-learning algorithm to train the vacuum cleaner's strategy. Q-learning is a reinforcement learning method that enables the agent (the vacuum cleaner) to discover an optimal strategy through exploration and exploitation. By iteratively updating the Q-values (quality estimates) for state-action pairs, the vacuum cleaner learns which actions are more advantageous in specific states.
